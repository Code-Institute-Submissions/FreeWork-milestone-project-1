## Website Description

This project is a website for a fictional Irish coworking business named FreeWork. The business specialises in offering a variety of working options such as hotdesking, resident desks and dedicated offices. This website exists to advertise the company online and connect it with potential customers and clients. With this goal in mind, the website is designed to present visitors with the most useful information to sell them on both the business and the concept of coworking. 

The website is designed to reflect the modern and innovative nature of the industry and the FreeWork business, in particular, using a cool and minimal layout with no cluttering elements and effective use of negative space. The website is responsive across all screen sizes to ensure that customers can view the website and have positive UX regardless of how they access it.

### Design

#### Design Overview

One of the most important design aspirations for this website was the desire to have a very clean, consistent and calm aesthetic. This intention of this website was to advertise a business to potential customers so I considered it essential that the design would work to sell its atmosphere, ethos and energy.

#### Colour Scheme
![Image of the colour scheme](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/FreeWork-colour-scheme.png)

For the colour scheme, I decided to go with a relaxed and calming selection of colours. The colours in use in the site are all either shades of blue and shades of pink. The two most prominent colours, marked above as #59abbd and #f9e3e3 are primarily used as background elements. They provide relaxed and minimal backgrounds to sections and elements of the webpage that allow for a positive reading and scrolling experience while in no way distracting from foreground elements or information. The third colour above, #e75b74 is a stronger shade of pink that is used against the lighter pink shade to accent and provide a contrast to it. This shade is used primarily in buttons to provide a visual pop and draw the eye to them. It is also used sparingly on decorative visual elements such as icons as I believe it allows the viewer to read the content and intention of the icon more quickly. The final colour used, #3e4c5e, is a navy - grey shade. This colour is almost solely used as the primary colour of text on the website. This colour was chosen as I believe it suited the background colours and tones more than a pure black font colour. The dark blue tone allows it to stand out against both of the background colours as well as the white space used in the website.

#### Typography
The primary font used ion the design is *Poppins*. This font was chosen because it is a very clean and simple font that is easy to read and never gets to busy. I decided that this would be important when the majority of the information on the website would be presented through text. Alongside *Poppins*, *Fira* *Sans* is used to differentiate section headers and other heading elements. This contrast is useful to quickly draw the eye to the most important information and help visitors to orientate themselves in the layout and structure of the website quickly.

#### Imagery
As it is a fictional business all of the imagery I use is stock imagery from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). There are only a few images in use in the design which is for a couple of reasons. Most importantly I wanted to maintain a minimal aesthetic without too many large visual elements and I, therefore, opted to use icons to emphasise points and information as opposed to images. These icons could be styled using CSS to match the colour scheme and scale of surrounding elements much more effectively than images could have been and they helped to maintain a consistent theme and colour palette.


### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) They were used to design the majority of the website before I began coding, this allowed for a much smoother development cycle as the major design decisions were already made and I could simply follow the wireframes when writing the code. There were changes to layout and design approaching the end of the project as I decided what was working and what was not working at different device sizes. However, these changes were generally small in essence and the major design decisions carried through from the wireframes.

### Testing

I tested the website thoroughly, throughout development I would ensure that it looked and behaved as designed and laid out in the wireframes. The website was tested at multiple scales, through desktop and mobile devices.


At the end of the project, the code was put through CSS and HTML validators to ensure there were no syntax errors.
-   [Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) - [HTML Testing Results](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/html-validation.png)

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals

-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly and easily interpret the purpose of the site and the business.
  1. Upon reaching the landing page there is a clearly visible heading at the bottom of the page saying "About FreeWork".
  2. A first-time visitor trying to find out more about the site would immediately navigate to this section wherein there is information about the business and the service they provide.
  3. Alternatively at the top of the page there is a navigation bar containing a clearly labelled link to the "About Us" section.
  
-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to intuitively understand the navigation structure and to be able to navigate to each section simply.
  1. By following industry common practice of locating the navigation bar along the top of the screen and making it clearly visible and clearly legible anybody who has experience using websites will be able to intuitively select the section that they wish to navigate to. 
  2. The website is also designed to be a single page design. This means that by simply scrolling down the user will progress through the website in the same order as was established in the navigation bar.
  3. The navigation bar is programmed to be fixed to the top of the screen, so that no matter where on the page the visitor is, they will always be able to navigate back to the landing page or to the section of their choice.

-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out information about coworking and the reasons why it would work for me.
  1. Any visitor hoping to find out why they should opt for a coworking plan as opposed to an alternative would notice and navigate to the "Benefits" link in the navigation bar on the top of the screen.
  2. Alternatively the hierarchal layout of the page design means that they will reach that information by scrolling down the page as they will be drawn to the "Why Choose Us?" heading of the section.

- ### Potential customer goals
-  #### As a potential customer I want to be able to get in contact to find out about the services on offer.
1. A potential customer coming to the site and wanting to reach out to the company will know that they need to find the "Contact Us" section as this is common practice for websites.
2. The visitor will be drawn to the clearly visible navigation bar where the "Contact" link is located and by clicking that link they will be brought directly to the contact us section, where they are presented with a number of contact options".

-  #### As a potential customer I want to be able to book a tour to see the spaces for myself.
1. A potential customer who wishes to arrange a tour to see some of the spaces on offer would upon reaching the landing page be presented with the call to action button that says "Arrange a Tour Now". 
2. By clicking this button a modal window will appear asking for their details and their preferred date for a visit. By filling out these fields and submitting the form the company will receive their details and be able to contact the visitor to confirm the arrangement.
3. Alternatively if the potential customer missed the CTA button, they would navigate to the "Contact Us" section where they will be presented with another option to "Arrange a Tour" and open the modal window.

- ### Existing Customer goals
- #### As an existing customer I want to be able to connect further with the company to keep up to date with any news or developments.
1. An existing customer would already be relatively familiar with the layout of the site and would navigate to the footer of the page which is where they will find links to the company's social media accounts clearly displayed.
