## Website Description

This project is a website for a fictional Irish coworking business named FreeWork. The business specialises in offering a variety of working options such as hotdesking, resident desks and dedicated offices. This website exists to advertise the company online and connect it with potential clients and partners. With this goal in mind, the website is designed to present visitors with the most useful information to sell them on both the business and the concept of coworking. 

The website is designed to reflect the modern and innovative nature of the industry and the FreeWork business, in particular, using a cool and minimal layout with no cluttering elements and effective use of negative space. The website is responsive across all screen sizes to ensure that customers can view the website and have positive UX regardless of how they choose to access it.

### Design

#### Design Overview

One of the most important design aspirations for this website was the desire to have a very clean, consistent and calm aesthetic. This intention of this website was to advertise a business to potential customers so I considered it essential that the design would work to sell its modern atmosphere, ethos and energy.

#### Colour Scheme
![Image of the colour scheme](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/FreeWork-colour-scheme.png)

For the colour scheme, I decided to go with a relaxed and calming selection of colours. The colours in use in the site are all either shades of blue or shades of pink. The two most prominent colours, marked above as #59abbd and #f9e3e3 although at a lower opacity level in the design, are primarily used for background elements. They provide relaxed and minimal backgrounds to sections and elements of the webpage that allow for a positive reading and scrolling experience while in no way distracting from foreground elements or information. The third colour above, #e75b74 is a stronger shade of pink that is used against the lighter pink colour to accent and provide a contrast to it. This shade is used primarily in buttons to provide a visual pop and draw the eye to them. It is also used sparingly on decorative visual elements such as icons as I believe it allows the viewer to read the content and intention of the icon more quickly. The final colour used, #3e4c5e, is a navy - grey shade. This colour is almost solely used as the primary colour of text on the website. This colour was chosen as I believe it suited the background colours and tones more than a pure black font colour. The dark blue tone allows it to stand out against both of the background colours as well as the white space used in the website.

#### Typography
The primary font used in the design is *Poppins*. This font was chosen because it is a very clean and simple font that is easy to read and never gets too busy. I decided that this would be important when the majority of the information on the website would be presented through text. Alongside *Poppins*, *Fira* *Sans* is used to differentiate section headers and other heading elements. This contrast is useful to quickly draw the eye to the most important information and help visitors to orientate themselves in the layout and structure of the website quickly.

#### Imagery
As it is a fictional business all of the imagery I use is stock imagery from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). There are only a few images in use in the design which is for a couple of reasons. Most importantly I wanted to maintain a minimal aesthetic without too many large visual elements and I, therefore, opted to use icons to emphasise points and information as opposed to images. These icons could be styled using CSS to match the colour scheme and scale of surrounding elements much more effectively than images could have been and they helped to maintain a consistent theme and colour palette.


### Wireframes

The wireframes for the website were developed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) They were used to design the majority of the website before I began coding, this allowed for a much smoother development cycle as the major design decisions were already made and I could simply follow the wireframes when writing the code. There were changes to layout and design approaching the end of the project as I decided what was working and what was not working at different device sizes. However, these changes were generally small and the major design decisions carried through from the wireframes.

## Features

- ### Landing Page
![Landing Page](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/landing-page.jpg)

The landing page consists of a large full-width image of office space in the background with an eye-catching heading in front of it that reads "Join Ireland's Most Exciting Coworking Movement", below that heading there is a Call to Action button that reads "Arrange a Tour Now" and will call up a modal window with a form when pressed. This is designed to immediately connect with the visitor and to encourage them to take action. The landing page is designed to not be the full height of the device window to allow a hint of the next section below and to inform users that scrolling down the page is possible. If it was a full-size image then the potential is there for a user to believe that the only method of traversing the website is by using the navigation bar.

- ### About Section
![About Section](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/features-about.png)

The About FreeWork Section is very simple and clean. It lays down the template for the rest of the sections on the website with a large heading element "About FreeWork" with a horizontal line beneath it separating if from the content of the section below it. The content is displayed in a condensed form with each point having an icon and a small piece of text. The icon of each piece will change colour when the text is hovered over to help reinforce the visual connection between the parts.

- ### Benefits Section 
![Benefits Section](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/features-benefits.png)

The benefits section contains 4 different cards each highlighting a different benefit of coworking. I designed the cards with icons at the top followed by the title and then the content so that as the visitor scrolls down the page their attention will be first captured by the icons and then their eyes will be drawn down to the name of the benefit. That interaction between first identifying the icon and interpreting the possible connotations and then having the idea confirmed through the text I believe would lead to a small positive response for the reader.

- ### Spaces Section 
![Spaces Section](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/features-spaces.jpg)

The spaces section is designed to create a sense of exploration or of a tour itself. By displaying the individual spaces linearly by scrolling down the page the visitor comes across the spaces and learns about them progressively. This also serves to familiarise the user with the appearance of the business and the modern and exciting spaces portrayed through the images serve to create a positive perspective of the space and could inspire them to want to explore them in person as well.

- ### Contact Section
![Contact Section](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/features-contact.png)

The contact section is broken into two boxes. On the left or first box is a simple form for submitting messages to the business. This involves three input fields, for the visitor's name, email address and their message. There is then a button for submitting the message. Each of the input fields has a required attribute to ensure that all of the details are included when sending the message. As with all buttons on the website, it has a hover effect where both the background and text colour change to reinforce to the user that it is a button that can be interacted with. The second box contains two options, one is a button that will call up the "Arrange a tour modal" and the other is a phone number where a visitor could click to be brought to their phone call app to call the business. When the phone call link is hovered over the font size of the number increases to catch the attention of the visitor and to inform them that it is not just a static string.

- ### Modal Window 
![Modal Window](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/features-modal.png)

The Modal window was designed to be as clear and easy to understand as possible. I considered it very important to maintain the aesthetic of the main page so the colour theme is used as the primary border colour on input fields as well as the background and hover effect colours of the Close and Submit buttons. The form itself again has all input fields set to required so that the visitor will be assured both that the submit button is functioning correctly and that all of the information is being sent. There are four ways to close the modal if the visitor does not want to complete the form to ensure positive UX for the user. The user can either press the ESC key on their keyboard, click anywhere outside of the modal window, or click either the Close button or the x button in the top right of the window. This is in line with conventional window design and should be intuitive to understand for a user to navigate.

- ### Responsive design
![Responsive design](https://github.com/zackgithuboriginal/FreeWork-milestone-project-1/blob/master/assets/images/responsive-design.png)

The website is designed using media queries and Bootstrap's grid utility to have responsive design at all sizes. With a mobile-first design, the website needed to be engaging and functional even at the smallest of device sizes. As visible in the above image, the navbar is designed to compress into a dropdown menu with a toggleable button to the right end of the navbar. This is to maintain a clear and uncluttered navbar at small screen sizes and using the three-line hamburger design icon for the button as is conventional ensures that visitors will understand and intuit the design. The sections of the design all respond to small screen sizes in their way however typically as seen in the image components will consolidate towards the centre and at the smallest sizes, they will align themselves vertically. This allows the design to maintain the hierarchal distribution of information and to guarantee a positive scrolling experience for the user.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

- ### First Time Visitor Goals

-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to quickly and easily interpret the purpose of the site and the business.
  1. Upon reaching the landing page there is a visible heading at the bottom of the page saying "About FreeWork".
  2. A first-time visitor trying to find out more about the site would immediately navigate to this section wherein there is information about the business and the service they provide.
  3. Alternatively at the top of the page there is a navigation bar containing a clearly labelled link to the "About Us" section.
  
-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to intuitively understand the navigation structure and to be able to navigate to each section simply.
  1. By following industry common practice of locating the navigation bar along the top of the screen and making it visible and legible to anybody who has experience using websites will be able to intuitively select the section that they wish to navigate to. 
  2. The website is also designed to be a single page design. This means that by simply scrolling down the user will progress through the website in the same order as was established in the navigation bar.
  3. The navigation bar is programmed to be fixed to the top of the screen, so that no matter where on the page the visitor is, they will always be able to navigate back to the landing page or the section of their choice.

-  #### As a First Time Visitor, I want to find out information about coworking and the reasons why it would work for me.
  1. Any visitor hoping to find out why they should opt for a coworking plan as opposed to an alternative would notice and navigate to the "Benefits" link in the navigation bar on the top of the screen.
  2. Alternatively the hierarchal layout of the page design means that they will reach that information by scrolling down the page as they will be drawn to the "Why Choose Us?" heading of the section.

- ### Potential customer goals
-  #### As a potential customer I want to be able to get in contact to find out about the services on offer.
1. A potential customer coming to the site and wanting to reach out to the company will know that they need to find the "Contact Us" section as this is common practice for websites.
2. The visitor will be drawn to the visible navigation bar where the "Contact" link is located and by clicking that link they will be brought directly to the contact us section, where they are presented with several contact options.

-  #### As a potential customer I want to be able to book a tour to see the spaces for myself.
1. A potential customer who wishes to arrange a tour to see some of the spaces on offer would upon reaching the landing page be presented with the call to action button that says "Arrange a Tour Now". 
2. By clicking this button a modal window will appear asking for their details and their preferred date for a visit. By filling out these fields and submitting the form the company will receive their details and be able to contact the visitor to confirm the arrangement.
3. Alternatively if the potential customer missed the CTA button, they would navigate to the "Contact Us" section where they will be presented with another option to "Arrange a Tour" and open the modal window.

- ### Existing Customer goals
- #### As an existing customer I want to be able to connect further with the company to keep up to date with any news or developments.
1. An existing customer would already be relatively familiar with the layout of the site and would navigate to the footer of the page which is where they will find links to the company's social media accounts displayed.

## Deployment

The project is deployed and live using GitHub pages. This is a very useful tool and it is was setup very simply. By going into the repository where the project is saved and then going to the settings menu by clicking the gear icon inside the repository. From inside the settings menu I navigated to the GitHub Pages section where I was presented with the option to choose the Branch and Root folder of the repository from which to source the project from. 

After filling out these two options you select the "Save" button and it presents a URL on which the project is now hosted.
